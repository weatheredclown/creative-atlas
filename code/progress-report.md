# Creative Atlas - Final Progress Report

This document outlines the development progress of the Creative Atlas application against the v0.1 product specification.

## Overall Status: Feature Complete (M1-M3)

Development has reached a state of feature completeness for the primary milestones (M1-M3). The application successfully implements all core tenets of the product vision, providing a robust, gamified, and AI-enhanced platform for personal knowledge management and creative world-building. The core loop of seeding ideas, growing them into linked artifacts, and exporting them is fully functional.

## Feature Breakdown vs. Spec

### 1. Vision & Design Tenets

- **Play First:** **Implemented**.
  - XP system is functional and provides immediate feedback.
  - Quests and Achievements are implemented, encouraging user engagement.
  - Micro-wins (creating seeds, linking artifacts, completing tasks, using AI) grant XP.

- **Graph Native:** **Implemented**.
  - The data model is built around Projects, Artifacts, and Relations.
  - The UI allows for creating `RELATES_TO` links between any two artifacts.
  - A visual, interactive graph view is a primary way to navigate project data.

- **Progressive Depth:** **Implemented**.
  - **Layer 1 (Seed):** Fully functional via the 'New Seed' modal for quick capture of any artifact type.
  - **Layer 2 (Grow):** Fully functional. Project dashboards include a Table view, Graph view, and a Kanban board for tasks.
  - **Layer 3 (Forge):** Implemented. Rich, contextual editors are available for `Conlang`, `Story`, `Character`, `Wiki`, and `Location` artifacts.
  - **Layer 4 (Showcase):** Implemented. Users can export all project artifacts to a single CSV file or export individual artifacts to self-contained Markdown files.

- **Open I/O:** **Implemented**.
  - Round-trip data is possible via CSV import and export.
  - Markdown export with YAML frontmatter ensures data portability and no lock-in.

- **Multimodal & Creator-Centric:** **Implemented**.
  - The data model and UI support various artifact types, from text (Wiki) and structured data (Character, Location) to lists (Story, Conlang).
  - AI copilots ('Lore Weaver', 'Conlang Smith') are integrated directly into the editing experience to accelerate creative work.

### 2. Core Domain Model & Data Shapes

- **Node Types:** **Implemented**. The `Project` and `Artifact` types in `types.ts` cover all specified nodes, including `Story`, `Character`, `Location`, `Conlang`, `Wiki`, and `Task`.
- **Edge Types:** **Implemented**. A generic `Relation` system is in place.
- **Data Shapes:** **Implemented**. The TypeScript interfaces accurately reflect the JSON schemas for all core entities.

### 3. Views & Editors

- **Project Dashboard:** **Implemented**. The main view serves as a dashboard with a view switcher for Table, Graph, and Kanban.
- **Table View:** **Implemented**.
- **Graph View:** **Implemented**.
- **Kanban / Timeline:** **Implemented**. A functional Kanban board for `Task` artifacts is complete.
- **Artifact Workbenches:** **Implemented**. Contextual editors are available for all major non-generic artifact types:
  - `Conlang` (Lexicon Editor)
  - `Story/Novel` (Scene Card Editor)
  - `Character` (Bio & Traits Editor)
  - `Wiki` (Markdown Editor with Live Preview)
  - `Location` (Description & Features Editor)

### 4. Gamification System

- **Stats (XP, Level):** **Implemented**.
- **XP Sources:** **Implemented**. XP is awarded for creating seeds, linking artifacts, generating lexemes, and completing tasks.
- **Quests:** **Implemented**. A 'Daily Quests' component tracks short-term goals.
- **Achievements:** **Implemented**. An `Achievements` component tracks long-term goals.

### 5. AI Copilots (Integrations)

- **AI Provider Abstraction:** **Implemented** via `services/geminiService.ts`.
- **Lore Weaver:** **Implemented** in the `ArtifactDetail` view.
- **Conlang Smith:** **Implemented** in the `ConlangLexiconEditor`.

### 6. Import / Export (Round-Trip)

- **CSV/TSV:** **Implemented**. Artifacts can be imported from and exported to a single CSV file.
- **Markdown Bundles:** **Implemented**. Individual artifacts can be exported to a `.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

## Conclusion

The Creative Atlas application now stands as a powerful and engaging tool that successfully realizes the vision laid out in the product specification. It balances immediate, playful interaction with deep, progressive complexity, all while ensuring data ownership and portability for the user. The project is ready for user testing and further polish based on feedback (M4).
