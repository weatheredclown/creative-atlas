## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a stepper tutorial that guides new users through the process of creating a world, adding connected projects, and publishing their work in Creative Atlas. The tutorial will use a sample world called "Aethelgard" to provide a practical, hands-on experience. The goal is to onboard new users effectively, showcasing the platform's key features in an engaging and easy-to-follow format.
