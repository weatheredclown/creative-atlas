# Sacred Truth — Story Overview

## Premise
Ruth is a vampire pressed into service by the Church's clandestine order of monster hunters. Every mission promises absolution for her past sins, yet every hunt drags her deeper into a conspiracy where the Church barters with the same darkness it condemns. The title's pun places "Ruth" inside "truth," signaling how faith can be warped by the very monsters it seeks to purge.

## Principal Characters
- **Ruth** — The Church's vampire operative. Stoic, disciplined, and suffused with guilt, she clings to duty as penance even as she suspects the holy mission is a lie.
- **Father Max** — An aging priest who forged the order's crusade. His unshakable devotion becomes a brittle armor once he learns the hierarchy has long courted the enemy.
- **Jen** — Ruth's ancient confidante who masks millennia of experience beneath playful banter. She anchors Ruth emotionally while hiding that she may have been the assailant in the alley that ignited the investigation.
- **Anya (Steamweave universe)** — A parallel heroine whose struggles in the Steamweave setting mirror Ruth's: both battle institutions built on sanctified corruption. She never appears directly in Sacred Truth, but her story echoes as a thematic resonance.

## Core Themes
- **Faith versus corruption** — The Church acts as both shepherd and wolf, forcing Ruth to weigh loyalty against justice.
- **Truth as a weapon** — Revelation can damn as easily as it redeems when institutions weaponize confession and secrecy.
- **Monstrous humanity** — Sacred Truth asks who defines monstrosity when vampires show compassion and the faithful traffic in horror.
- **Loyalty and guilt** — Ruth's vow binds her to the Church even as each betrayal compounds her self-loathing.

## Visual and Tonal Palette
Neo-gothic noir: cold stone cathedrals, candlelit confessionals, and silver-and-crimson chiaroscuro. Think Castlevania's baroque dread filtered through a Vatican thriller—quiet interrogations beneath stained glass, relic-lit catacombs, and rain-slick rooftops where loyalty bleeds into sin.
