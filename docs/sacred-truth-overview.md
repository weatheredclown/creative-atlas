# Sacred Truth — Overview

## Premise
Ruth is a vampire who hunts her own kind as an operative of the Church's clandestine order. At first her crusade seems a path to redemption, but each investigation exposes deeper rot: the Church itself is entangled with the evil she fights. The title’s wordplay hides her conflict in plain sight—Ruth is literally inside “truth,” embodying how faith can be twisted into sanctified corruption.

## Main Characters
- **Ruth** — A vampire bound to the Church by oath and guilt. Stoic, exhausted, and simmering with repressed rage, she clings to loyalty as penance even as the lies beneath her faith fracture. She embodies the “sacred lie,” devotion built atop unforgiven sin.
- **Father Max** — An aging priest who has dedicated his life to vampire hunting. His certainty in the Church’s righteousness is both shield and blindfold, leaving him unprepared for the revelation that his holy war may serve darkness.
- **Jen** — Ruth’s best friend and confidante, a playful, thousand-year-old vampire whose levity masks deep wisdom. She steadies Ruth with humor and unconditional affection, yet may harbor secrets of her own—including a possible attack on the human Leeanna glimpsed early in the story.
- **Anya** *(shared universe resonance)* — Though not a direct participant, Anya’s battles in **Steamweave** mirror Ruth’s struggle against institutions that hide corruption behind holy or industrial façades.

## Themes
- **Faith vs. corruption** — The Church shelters believers yet conspires with the monsters it claims to banish.
- **Truth as a weapon** — Revelation can purify or condemn; the right truth in the wrong hands destroys.
- **Monstrous humanity** — The story asks who decides what is monstrous when both humans and vampires wield brutality.
- **Loyalty and guilt** — Ruth’s allegiance offers purpose but also chains her to unhealed guilt.

## Aesthetic & Tone
Neo-gothic noir mooding drenches the world in stone cathedrals, wavering candlelight, and blood-red glass. Scenes unfold in chiaroscuro palettes—silver blades and crimson vestments cut against endless shadow—blending **Castlevania**-style grandeur with the moral ambiguity of a Vatican thriller. Quiet confessions reverberate beneath vaulted arches while sins seep through every prayer.
