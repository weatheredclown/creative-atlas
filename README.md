# Creative Atlas ‚Äî Product Spec v0.1

A playful, gamified personal knowledge system for organizing web comics, wikis, websites, games, GitHub repos, stories, conlangs, AI‚Äë and hand‚Äëwritten novels, and more ‚Äî with both creative canvases and tabular import/export.

üìò **Universe Briefs:** Looking for a deep dive on a flagship world? Start with the [Dustland Project Overview](docs/dustland-overview.md) to see how the retro RPG framework, persona mask system, and CRT aesthetic map into Creative Atlas artifacts.
üìò Lore reference: see [`docs/darv-language.md`](docs/darv-language.md) for the Darv language primer that anchors Tamenzut rituals, myths, and conlang work.

## Product Roadmap

### Guiding Principles ‚Äî Creative Atlas Built for Tim
- One brain, many worlds: everything (stories, games, art, conlangs, repos, rulesets) lives inside one creative OS.
- Progress through play: quests, XP, and incremental additions turn lorebuilding into a game.
- Reveal complexity gradually: start with notebook simplicity and expand toward wiki ‚Üí database ‚Üí living archive ‚Üí game UI.
- AI as a co-author (Gemini-first): it organizes, recommends links, and surfaces forgotten lore while Tim approves canon.
- Exports always matter: every world can produce wikis, game seeds, bibles, sheets, lexicons, and more.
- Atlas ‚â† Notion ‚Äî Atlas = Lore engine + authoring pipeline.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Core Lore OS (MVP)
The ‚ÄúOrganize My Worlds Without Pain‚Äù release.
- [ ] Project selection across Sacred Truth, Dustland, Aputi, and more.
- [ ] Core artifact types at launch (characters, timelines, locations, rules/systems, terminology, scenes/chapters, game modules/quests).
- [ ] Rich text editor with Markdown and AI assist.
- [ ] Relationship graph linking characters ‚Üî events ‚Üî worlds.
- [ ] Import pipelines for Markdown and text dumps (chat, drafts).
- [ ] Export pipelines for chapter bible PDF/Markdown and lore JSON for game engines (Dustland ACK modules).
- [ ] World dashboards to add lore, visualize connections, and link crossover projects (Dustland NPC ‚Üê‚Üí Sacred Truth vampire cameo).
- [ ] "Add one fact" button to reduce overwhelm.
- [ ] "Reveal depth" toggle for simple ‚Üí detailed fields.
- [ ] "Narrative need heatmap" that flags characters not seen recently.
- [ ] Memory sync with Gemini-powered conversations gated by user approval.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Gamification & XP Loop
"Writing and making worlds gives XP. Lorebuilding is a game."
- [ ] XP system tied to adding artifacts, refining drafts, importing pages, and completing quests.
- [ ] Daily challenge board to surface fresh prompts.
- [ ] Level-up tree with creativity perks (Lore Weaver, Archivist, World Alchemist, Dungeon Master).
- [ ] Collectible inspiration cards covering archetypes, vibes, visual prompts, and genre modifiers.
- [ ] Player profile with creative streak tracking.
- [ ] Inspiration deck draw interface for mid-writing boosts.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî World Simulation Layer
"World memory and logic enforcement."
- [ ] Time and continuity tracking across worlds.
- [ ] Lore validator to prevent contradictions against canon.
- [ ] Magic system structure builder (Tamenzut rules encoded).
- [ ] Physics/metaphysics constraint annotations.
- [ ] "World age" progression that evolves lore events.
- [ ] Factions and conflicts system for PIT, Dustland, and the 4X project.
- [ ] Simulated history heatmap and "What changed this century?" views.
- [ ] NPC memory map linking Dustland, Sacred Truth, Spatch, and beyond.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Narrative & Game Pipelines
Stories become game worlds, and game worlds fuel story arcs.
- [ ] Scene board for novels and narrative arcs.
- [ ] Quest board for game modules.
- [ ] Character arcs tooling with progression states.
- [ ] Procedural encounter generator blending Dustland and PIT lore.
- [ ] Story ‚Üí module export supporting Dustland ACK, D&D cards, visual novel scenes, and script formats.
- [ ] Automated exports for character sheets, campaign packets, AI asset prompts, and lore codexes.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî AI Companions & Muse Engine
Personalized Gemini-driven co-writers trained on Tim‚Äôs universes.
- [ ] Archivist agent that finds contradictions and suggests consistency fixes.
- [ ] Muse agent providing inspiration, aesthetics, and poetic voice.
- [ ] Game Designer agent that turns lore into encounters.
- [ ] Conlang Steward agent that grows Darv.
- [ ] Publisher Mode that turns the atlas into a website/wiki.
- [ ] NPC memory mode for canon-locked roleplay.
- [ ] Truth/Canon lock workflow where every addition requires approval.
- [ ] Lore distillation pipeline to produce mythic summaries from notes.

### Technical Stack (Tailored to Tim)
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind.
- Database: Firestore or SQLite with local sync.
- Data layer: Zod schemas.
- Storage: Flat files plus JSON exports.
- Graph: d3-force or Cytoscape.
- Editor: TipTap or BlockNote.
- Infra: Cloud + local-first offline mode.
- AI: Modular (Gemini + local embedding store, following the existing integration patterns).

### Why This Works for Tim
| Tim‚Äôs trait | Atlas feature |
| --- | --- |
| Moves across many projects | Multi-world dashboards |
| Likes incremental structure | Reveal-depth UI + small quests |
| Worlds merge & echo | Cross-universe linking & export |
| Games + novels coexist | Game + narrative pipelines |
| Aesthetics matter | Inspiration card system |
| Conlangs & rules | System builders + lexicon manager |
| Iterative AI partner | Canon guardrails + muse agents |

### Final Vision
This isn‚Äôt a note app ‚Äî it‚Äôs the Creative Engine, Lore Forge, and AI Codex Compiler. Sacred Truth vampires update Dustland myths, Tamenzut relics shape PIT fauna, Spatch emotional rules cross-pollinate Steamweave factions, STACI Starlight earns her meta show bible, and the Aputi timeline ripples into Edruel artifacts. Tim‚Äôs creative continuity becomes visible, lovable, and playable ‚Äî a personal Alexandria and an evolving creative skill tree.

## Productionization Roadmap

### Persistent, Multi-User Data Layer
- [x] Launch a managed database-backed service (Firebase) and migrate project, artifact, and XP storage out of in-memory mocks.
- [x] Expose CRUD endpoints with pagination, validation, and schema enforcement so multiple users can manage separate worlds safely.
- [x] Move CSV/Markdown import and export flows to backend workers or endpoints to centralize validation and keep the UI responsive during large transfers.
- üìò See [`docs/firebase-backend-migration.md`](docs/firebase-backend-migration.md) for the recommended Firebase + Firestore architecture and step-by-step migration plan (starting with authentication setup).

### Authentication, Authorization, and Profiles
- [x] Add sign-up and login flows with token-based authentication for the web client.
- [x] Associate every project and artifact with an owner and enforce row-level authorization rules.
- [x] Persist user-specific settings, XP totals, and achievements so progress follows accounts across devices.

### Collaboration & Offline-Resilient UX (do not implement yet)
- [ ] Decide on collaboration scope (real-time, turn-based, etc.) and add the necessary synchronization layer (websockets, CRDTs) for shared editing.
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution to keep the workspace fluid during network delays.
- [ ] Add background draft syncing and local caching so editors remain usable when offline or during service interruptions.

### AI Platform Hardening (low priority)
- [ ] Proxy Gemini (and future model) calls through a secure backend to keep API keys out of the client.
- [ ] Capture the current exact-title recommendation heuristic used by templates and schedule richer ranking once higher-priority systems land.

### Robust Import/Export & Publishing
- [ ] Validate CSV/Markdown inputs on the server and return actionable schema errors to the client.
- [ ] Turn ‚ÄúPublish Site‚Äù into a backend-driven export that produces deployable static bundles hosted on durable storage/CDNs.

### Operational Readiness
- [x] Add linting, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests alongside the existing Vite build to create a regression safety net.
- [x] Stand up continuous integration that runs the full test suite on every pull request.

### Productization & Compliance (low priority)
- [ ] Layer in onboarding, documentation, accessibility, and localization improvements for first-time users.
- [ ] Establish policies for data retention, content moderation, and privacy covering generated and uploaded content.
- [ ] Provide support and education content (tutorials, FAQs) that make the product approachable for new creators.

## Running the App Locally

The interactive prototype lives in the `code/` directory and is a client-side React application rendered through `index.tsx` and the HTML shell in `index.html`. Follow the steps below to get it running on your machine.

### 1. Install dependencies

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer.
2. From the repository root, move into the application directory and install the dependencies (Vite, React, TypeScript, etc.):

   ```bash
   cd code
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Configure environment variables

The frontend expects Firebase configuration in `code/.env.local`:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
```

When the backend API is running (see below), expose its URL so CSV/Markdown import/export calls are routed through the server:

```
VITE_DATA_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### 3. Start the backend API (optional but recommended)

The `server/` package exposes authenticated CRUD endpoints that wrap Firestore and handle bulk import/export work. Run it locally with:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server expects Firebase Admin credentials via environment variables (`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, and `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`). When these are set, the API automatically provisions Firestore reads/writes on behalf of the signed-in user.

Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) so deployed environments return the proper CORS headers during browser preflight checks. For example:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://creative-atlas.web.app,https://staging.creative-atlas.web.app
```

For App Engine deployments, mirror the same value in [`server/app.yaml`](server/app.yaml) so the runtime picks up the environment variable automatically.

When GitHub Actions deploys `main`, it now reuses that App Engine configuration. Store a service-account JSON (granted App Engine Deployer permissions) in the `GCP_APP_ENGINE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` repository secret so [the merge deployment workflow](.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml) can authenticate and run `gcloud app deploy` with the `server/app.yaml` manifest.

### 4. Start the development server

Use the Vite dev server to run the app with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) you can open in a browser.

### 5. Build & preview production assets

To generate an optimized static build and preview it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build artifacts land in `code/dist`, and `npm run preview` serves them with the same Vite configuration used in production.

### 6. Quality and test tooling

Run the automated quality gates before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

`npm test` executes the Vitest-powered unit and integration suite. `npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright smoke tests; the first run
may prompt you to install the required browsers via `npx playwright install`.

## 1) Vision & Design Tenets
**Vision:** A single ‚Äúcreative universe‚Äù that lets you seed ideas quickly, grow them into linked artifacts, and ship them ‚Äî while feeling like you‚Äôre playing a game.

**Tenets**
- **Play First:** Progress feels like leveling up. Micro‚Äëwins, streaks, quests.
- **Graph Native:** Everything is a node in a knowledge graph; relations are first‚Äëclass.
- **Progressive Depth:** Start simple. Reveal complexity when needed.
- **Open I/O:** Round‚Äëtrip data in clean CSV/JSON/Markdown. No lock‚Äëin.
- **Multimodal:** Text, code, art, audio, and links coexist.
- **Creator‚ÄëCentric:** Fast capture (‚åòK), offline‚Äëfriendly, one‚Äëkeystroke publish.

---

## 2) Primary Use Cases & Personas
