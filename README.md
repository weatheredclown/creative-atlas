# Creative Atlas — Product Spec v0.1

A playful, gamified personal knowledge system for organizing web comics, wikis, websites, games, GitHub repos, stories, conlangs, AI‑ and hand‑written novels, and more — with both creative canvases and tabular import/export.

## Productionization Roadmap

### Persistent, Multi-User Data Layer
- [x] Launch a managed database-backed service (e.g., Firebase) and migrate project, artifact, and XP storage out of in-memory mocks.
- [x] Expose CRUD endpoints with pagination, validation, and schema enforcement so multiple users can manage separate worlds safely.
- [x] Move CSV/Markdown import and export flows to backend workers or endpoints to centralize validation and keep the UI responsive during large transfers.

### Authentication, Authorization, and Profiles
- [x] Add sign-up and login flows with token-based authentication for the web client.
- [x] Associate every project and artifact with an owner and enforce row-level authorization rules.
- [x] Persist user-specific settings, XP totals, and achievements so progress follows accounts across devices.

### Collaboration & Offline-Resilient UX (do not implement yet)
- [ ] Decide on collaboration scope (real-time, turn-based, etc.) and add the necessary synchronization layer (websockets, CRDTs) for shared editing.
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution to keep the workspace fluid during network delays.
- [ ] Add background draft syncing and local caching so editors remain usable when offline or during service interruptions.

### AI Platform Hardening
- [ ] Proxy Gemini (and future model) calls through a secure backend to keep API keys out of the client.

### Robust Import/Export & Publishing
- [x] Validate CSV/Markdown inputs on the server and return actionable schema errors to the client.
- [x] Turn “Publish Site” into a backend-driven export that produces deployable static bundles hosted on durable storage/CDNs.

### Operational Readiness
- [x] Add linting, unit, integration, and end-to-end tests alongside the existing Vite build to create a regression safety net.
- [x] Stand up continuous integration that runs the full test suite on every pull request.

### Productization & Compliance (low priority)
- [ ] Layer in onboarding, documentation, accessibility, and localization improvements for first-time users.
- [ ] Establish policies for data retention, content moderation, and privacy covering generated and uploaded content.
- [ ] Provide support and education content (tutorials, FAQs) that make the product approachable for new creators.

## Running the App Locally

The interactive prototype lives in the `code/` directory and is a client-side React application rendered through `index.tsx` and the HTML shell in `index.html`. Follow the steps below to get it running on your machine.

### 1. Install dependencies

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer.
2. From the repository root, move into the application directory and install the dependencies (Vite, React, TypeScript, etc.):

   ```bash
   cd code
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Configure environment variables (optional, for AI copilots)

The AI assistants call Gemini via the `@google/genai` SDK and expect a `VITE_API_KEY` environment variable at build time. Follow the steps below to create a key and expose it to the app:

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and sign in with the Google account you want to use for Gemini access.
2. Click **Create API key**, then either select an existing Google Cloud project or create a new one. (Google will prompt you to enable the Gemini API and, if necessary, billing for that project.)
3. After the key is generated, copy its value and keep it somewhere secure.
4. Back in this repository, export the key before running any Vite commands, or add it to a `.env` file that Vite can read:

   ```bash
   export VITE_API_KEY="your-google-genai-key"
   ```

   For a persistent setup, create a file named `.env.local` inside `code/` with the line `VITE_API_KEY=your-google-genai-key`.

Without the key, the rest of the interface still loads, but AI-powered actions will be unavailable.

### 3. Start the development server

Use the Vite dev server to run the app with hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`) you can open in a browser.

### 4. Build & preview production assets

To generate an optimized static build and preview it locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build artifacts land in `code/dist`, and `npm run preview` serves them with the same Vite configuration used in production.

### 5. Quality and test tooling

Run the automated quality gates before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

`npm test` executes the Vitest-powered unit and integration suite. `npm run test:e2e` runs the Playwright smoke tests; the first run
may prompt you to install the required browsers via `npx playwright install`.

## 1) Vision & Design Tenets
**Vision:** A single “creative universe” that lets you seed ideas quickly, grow them into linked artifacts, and ship them — while feeling like you’re playing a game.

**Tenets**
- **Play First:** Progress feels like leveling up. Micro‑wins, streaks, quests.
- **Graph Native:** Everything is a node in a knowledge graph; relations are first‑class.
- **Progressive Depth:** Start simple. Reveal complexity when needed.
- **Open I/O:** Round‑trip data in clean CSV/JSON/Markdown. No lock‑in.
- **Multimodal:** Text, code, art, audio, and links coexist.
- **Creator‑Centric:** Fast capture (⌘K), offline‑friendly, one‑keystroke publish.

---

## 2) Primary Use Cases & Personas
**Tim the Solo Creator** (core): Seeds ideas, links Dustland (game) ↔ Spatch (comic) ↔ Tamenzut (novels) ↔ Darv (conlang), ships updates, exports tables.

**Collaborator/Contractor:** Receives a scoped “questline,” contributes assets, PR links, and notes.

**Reader/Playtester (optional):** Views read‑only builds, browses wikis, submits feedback.

---

## 3) Progressive Complexity Model (Layered UX)
- **Layer 1 — Seed:** Quick capture cards (idea, character, scene, mechanic, lexeme). Tags + light links.
- **Layer 2 — Grow:** Project dashboards, tables, Kanban, milestone tracker, basic graph view.
- **Layer 3 — Forge:** Rich editors (conlang lexicon, storyboard, world wiki), release pipelines, integrations.
- **Layer 4 — Showcase:** Publish static sites/wiki docs, export bundles, public gallery.

Reveal advanced controls as users “level up” or when data density crosses thresholds.

---

## 4) Core Domain Model (Graph)
**Node Types (selected):**
- **Project** (universe/container)
- **Artifact** (generic supertype with subtype): `WebComic | Wiki | Website | Game | Repo | Story | Novel | Conlang | Rulebook | CardGame | Character | Location | Faction | MagicSystem | LanguageLexicon | Scene | Chapter | Asset(Image/Audio/Video) | Prompt | DesignDoc | Task | Milestone | Release`
- **Person** (creator, collaborator)
- **Tag** (freeform taxonomy)

**Edge Types:**
- `CONTAINS(Project→Artifact)`, `RELATES_TO(Artifact↔Artifact)`
- `USES(Artifact→Repo|Asset|Prompt)`, `DERIVES_FROM(Artifact→Artifact)`
- `PUBLISHES_TO(Artifact→Website|Wiki)`, `PART_OF_SERIES(Story→Series)`
- `APPEARS_IN(Character→Scene|Chapter)`, `SET_IN(Scene→Location)`
- `SPEAKS(Character→Conlang)`, `DEFINES(Conlang→LanguageLexicon)`

**Status & Meta:** `status: idea|draft|in‑progress|alpha|beta|released`, `visibility: private|shared|public`, timestamps, owner, contributors.

---

## 5) Data Shapes (JSON Schemas)
> Minimal subset; full schemas grow as needed.

```json
// Project
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Project",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["id", "title"],

**ERD (textual):**
- `Project 1—* Artifact`
- `Artifact *—* Artifact (Relation with kind)`
- `Artifact 1—* Task`
- `Artifact 1—* Release`
- `Artifact 1—* Asset`
- `Conlang 1—* ConlangLexeme`

---

## 6) Views & Editors
**Home / Universe Map**
- Galaxy map of Projects (size = activity; color = status). Quick‑add; search; recent.

**Project Dashboard**
- Overview, Activity, Graph, Table, Kanban, Timeline, Publishing.

**Artifact Workbenches** (contextual toolsets):
- **Story/Novel:** scene cards, chapter tree, beat grid, POV tracker, world hooks.
- **Web Comic:** strip planner, panel board, character sheet links, asset slots, schedule.
- **Conlang:** lexicon table (inline CSV), phonology sketchpad, paradigms, usage examples.
- **Game (Dustland/Spatch):** module table, quest graph, asset vault, build links, PRs.
- **Wiki/Website:** page tree, link checker, publish target(s).
- **Repo:** branch heatmap, issue sync, release notes builder.

**Graph View**

---

## 7) Gamification System
**Stats:** Creator Level, XP, Streak, Focus Score (distraction‑free sessions), Release Count.

**XP Sources:** capture idea (+5), link two artifacts (+2), close task (+8), publish (+25), write 500 words (+10), add 10 lexemes (+10).

**Quests:**
- **Daily Forge:** add one seed + one link.
- **Lore Drop:** document a character/location.
- **Patch Day:** merge one repo PR and annotate the change.

**Achievements (examples):**
- *Steamweave Scholar:* 10 linked artifacts in Steamweave arc.
- *Darv Polyglot:* 200 lexemes + 10 example sentences.
- *Dustland Cartographer:* ship a playable module.

**Seasonal Tracks (optional):** thematic event (e.g., “Smog & Gears Month”).

---

## 8) Import / Export (Round‑Trip)
**CSV/TSV:** Any table view exportable/importable. Example columns:
- `artifacts.csv`: `id,type,projectId,title,summary,status,tags,links`
- `relations.csv`: `fromId,kind,toId`
- `lexicon.csv`: `id,lemma,pos,gloss,etymology,tags`
- `tasks.csv`: `id,artifactId,title,state,assignee,due,labels`

**Markdown Bundles:**
- `/ProjectName/README.md` (overview)
- `/Artifacts/<Type>/<Slug>.md` with YAML front‑matter
- `/Assets/…` mirrored; relation map as `relations.json`

**Integrations (Adapters):**
- **GitHub:** import repos, issues, PRs, releases; link commits → artifacts; publish release notes.
- **Local Folders:** watch a directory; treat `.md`/`.json` as source; two‑way sync.
- **Google Docs/Drive (optional):** one‑way import of docs into `Artifacts`.
- **Static Site Export:** push to GitHub Pages/Netlify (Wikis & Catalogs).

---

## 9) Integrations & Automations
- **GitHub GraphQL:** repo metadata, issues/PRs, releases, actions badges.
- **AI Providers (abstracted):** prompt templates for: synopsis, beat outline, lexeme suggestions, release notes; provider keys pluggable (OpenAI/Vertex etc.).
- **Build Hooks:** webhooks/CLI to trigger Dustland/Spatch builds and capture artifacts.

**Automation Rules (no‑code):**
- “When a chapter hits *ready*, generate release notes draft.”
- “When repo has a release, create a *Release* artifact and link to Storyboard.”

---

## 10) API Surface (GraphQL‑first)
**Types (subset):** `Project, Artifact, Relation, Task, Release, Asset, Tag, Person`

**Sample Queries/Mutations**
```graphql
query ProjectUniverse { projects { id title status tags } }

mutation AddArtifact($input: ArtifactInput!) { upsertArtifact(input: $input) { id type title } }

query Graph($projectId: ID!) {
  artifacts(projectId: $projectId) { id type title }
  relations(projectId: $projectId) { fromId kind toId }
}
```

**CLI Examples**
```bash
creative-atlas import csv artifacts.csv
creative-atlas export markdown ./out
creative-atlas publish static --project tamenzut --target gh-pages
```

---

## 11) Architecture
**Client:** Next.js (React) + Tailwind + Zustand (state) + React Flow (graph) + TanStack Table (grids) + TipTap (rich text) + Monaco (code).

**Server:** Node/TypeScript (Fastify) + GraphQL Yoga/Apollo. Background jobs via BullMQ (Redis).

**Data:** PostgreSQL (core tables), S3‑compatible storage (assets), Meilisearch (full‑text). Optional pgvector for semantic search. Graph modeled via `relations` table.

**Auth:** OAuth (GitHub/Google), access tokens (JWT), optional local accounts.

**Sync & Offline (v2):** local IndexedDB cache; CRDT (Yjs) for docs; background sync.

**Extensibility:** Plugin system with hooks (UI widgets, data adapters, automations). Manifest‑based: `conlang.lexicon` editor, `webcomic.panel-board`, `ai.prompt-wizard`.

---

## 12) Security & Privacy
- Encrypted at rest (DB + assets), HTTPS in transit.
- Project‑scoped roles: Owner, Editor, Commenter, Viewer.
- Local‑first modes keep private projects offline (v2 option).
- Export always available; delete truly deletes.

---

## 13) Templates (Tim‑Optimized)
- **Tamenzut Series:** `MagicSystem`, `Artifact: Rulebook`, `City`, `Faction`, `Edruel Ruins`, `Thread‑Weaving Log`, `Canon Tracker`.
- **Steamweave/Anya (coal‑punk):** `Clan`, `Workshop`, `Scene`, `Villain (Red‑Eyes)`, `Love Triangle Map`, `Release Notes`.
- **Dustland (RPG):** `Module`, `Quest`, `Persona Mask`, `NPC`, `Item`, `Tileset`, `Build`.
- **Spatch (Sport Comic):** `Team`, `Mentor`, `Rule Variant`, `Match`, `Panel Board`.
- **Darv (Conlang):** `Lexicon`, `Phonology`, `Paradigm`, `Proverb`, `Myth`.
- **Sacred Truth (Vampires):** `Episode`, `Case File`, `Monster Codex`, `Cathedral Asset`.

---

## 14) AI Copilots (Opt‑In)
- **Lore Weaver:** expands summaries, proposes links, conflict matrices.
- **Conlang Smith:** lexeme batches, paradigm tables, example sentences.
- **Story Doctor:** beat diagnostics, tension graphs, comp titles.
- **Release Bard:** changelogs → narrative release notes; trailer scripts.

**Prompt Slots (editable):**
- `synth_outline(projectId, artifactId, tone, constraints)`
- `lexeme_seed(conlangId, phonotactics, needed_pos)`
- `patch_notes(repo, tag_range, audience)`

---

## 15) Milestones & Roadmap (12–16 weeks)
**M1 — MVP (Weeks 1–4)**
- Core graph model, Projects/Artifacts/Relations
- Seed capture, Table view, basic Graph view
- CSV import/export (artifacts, relations)
- GitHub read‑only import (repos/issues/releases)

**M2 — Editors & Gamification (Weeks 5–8)**
- Conlang table editor; Storyboard; Kanban
- XP/Streaks/Quests + Achievements
- Markdown bundle export

**M3 — Publishing & Integrations (Weeks 9–12)**
- Static site exporter (Wikis/Docs)
- Release notes generator
- Search (Meilisearch), advanced filters

**M4 — Polish & Extensibility (Weeks 13–16)**
- Plugin API + 3 sample plugins (conlang, webcomic, ai prompts)
- Theming, keyboard palette, offline cache (light)

---

## 16) Success Metrics (local & qualitative)
- Time‑to‑first‑seed (<30s), daily streak length, tasks closed/week
- Linked‑artifact ratio (>0.6), export frequency, publish frequency
- Subjective: “feels like play” score (creator survey)

---

## 17) Risks & Mitigations
- **Scope Creep:** Use Layer model; ship per milestone.
- **Lock‑In Fear:** Invest early in clean import/export.
- **Perf on Big Graphs:** Server pagination, client virtualization, Meilisearch facets.
- **AI Provider Drift:** Abstract provider interface; prompt versioning.

---

## 18) Example Exports (snippets)
**Markdown (Story/Scene)**
```md
---
id: scn_steam_001
title: "Shroud and Gears"
project: steamweave
links: [chp1, red_eyes, city_foundry]
---
Smog rolled like a living thing…
```

**CSV (Lexicon)**
```csv
id,lemma,pos,gloss,etymology,tags
lx1,brubber,adj,strange;unusual,,core;darv
lx2,banushkadaum,n,ship (sea-building),,darv;mythic
```

---

## 19) Licensing & Openness
- Core app closed by default; **export formats and plugin APIs open**.
- Consider dual‑license or MIT for CLI/exporters.

---

## 20) Next Steps
1. Confirm MVP scope + must‑have editors (Conlang, Storyboard, Table, Graph).
2. Approve data shapes and initial adapters (GitHub, Markdown).
3. Build M1 spike: Project/Artifact/Relation + CSV I/O + basic Graph.
4. Prepare templates for Tamenzut, Steamweave, Dustland, Spatch, Darv.

**Creative Atlas** aims to be your playable second brain — one where **the work is the game** and your worlds finally live in one living graph.
